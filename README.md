# TierListRankingPollCalculator
Purpose: If you ever want to guage the the general view of something amongst a group of people, you can try to poll their opinions and then use this program to determine the general ranking, as well as the more specific position said thing falls in the category. With this happens to be 6 different letter categories used, that being S, A, B, C, D and F. Usually the meaning of each category goes a little something like this
- S tier: Best/favorites category
- A tier: Excellent/stuff you love
- B tier: Good/stuff you like or really like
- C tier: Neutral/stuff you haved mixed feelings for or don't have much of a strong opinion on
- D: Bad/stuff you dislike
- F: Terrible/stuff you full-on hate

How to run application: After your poll, count the amount of votes for each letter category. The program will prompt you for the amount of letters for S, A, B, C, D and then F tier. Afterwards, it will give you the average letter based on the median of these results, as well as a number to represent how 'far' up the category said average is. For example
- S tier: 5.01 - 6.00 points
- A tier: 4.01 - 5.00 points
- B tier: 3.01 - 4.00 points
- C tier: 2.00 - 3.00 points
- D tier: 1.00 - 1.99 points
- F tier: 0.00 - 0.99 points

I made this in order to do a poll series on Reddit. But you can apply this for about anything as long as you can poll at least 6 options. However, you can copy this code and modify it if you want to add more than just these 6 options in terms of calculating stuff (for example, maybe a Z tier to represent your absolute least favorite things of all time, AKA the category of stuff that is too bad just to be ranked F tier)
